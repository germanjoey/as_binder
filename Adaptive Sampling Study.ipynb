    "Unfortunately, APM only gives lump-sum per-hour data. That means we won't know when exactly each individual transaction event actually occurs. To get around this problem, I used inverse transform sampling (ITS) to \"generate\" the finer-grained data that we need. ITS is an algorithm that attempts to model a statistic as the sum of random variables of some type of distribution. In this case, we want a model of the number of transactions that will happen in a given period of time. I included a few different traffic models: one where events occur fairly regularly (i.e. according to a Poisson distribution), one where they vary a little more to represent varying source distance (a squared Poisson distribution), and one representing what I imagine the traffic would look like in a 2-tiered system. (a Compound Poisson distribution). You can find out more about common traffic models [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_network_traffic_models#Non-self-similar_traffic_models). Specific details are in the comments of the simulation code below.\n",

At that point, that count includes information about transactions that occurred nearly 2 minutes ago! Furthermore, the last harvest's numbers don't account for the new info that we've accumulated for this current harvest. For example, there might have been a burst of activity in the last harvest, and so its rate is far too high for this harvest, where transactions occur at more usual rate. Or vice versa.\n",

    "Now, how to predict the rate? Past rate won't necessarily correlate with future rate, so how can we be sure our rate prediction is stable? To answer that question, we can create a linear regression based on [Bayesian Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference). It can involve a lot of math, but luckily, in this case, it boils down pretty neatly in the end. The gist of it is that we use some sort of prior understanding of the data rate and then continuously update it using new incoming information. We can then use this to generate a prediction that we can be confident will be stable and unbiased. I'll put an explanation of the math in a comment in the code below, if you're curious about the details. The tl;dr is that the running average of the period of time between transaction becomes a better and better prediction on the final transaction count as we get closer and closer to the harvest point.\n",

For the former, we'll say that as long as a sampled=True count is closer to the target than near the end, it will be judged as acceptable. This is, in my opinion, a really wide range... if sampled=True payload counts were like a normal distribution, we should expect around ~95% to be within this middle range."

    "Comparing the original Python Agent implementation vs the Ruby Agent implementation, it seems that exponential backoff helps just a little bit when the transaction rate is regular, but helps quite a lot when the data rate varies more. For example, when harvesting once a minute (i.e. 60 times an hour) and targeting 10 samples per harvest under the \"Varying\" traffic model, the Python Agent gets near the target 78% of the time, while the Ruby Agent gets there 90% of the time, which is just a 15% improvement. However, switching to the \"Compound\" traffic model drops the Python Agent down to 35% and the Ruby Agent down to 46% - meaning that exponential backoff now provides a 31% benefit!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is most prominent when throughput is higher, e.g. near the middle of the day. This is because a percentage-wise difference has a higher absolute difference when it baseline value is higher. At any rate, I think that an exponential back-off strategy, as suggested by the spec, could really help here. I am going to add a few different sampling strategies to compare them. As an initial test, the Ruby Agent's currently implemented strategy improves the \"near the target\" count from 29% to 40%, which is a huge improvement."

That's because the acceptance criteria is pretty wide already... that is to say, these extra calculations may help turn 9s and 11s into 10s, but since the base adaptive sampling already gets most harvests into the \"acceptable\" area there's not many others for the fancy one to help with."
